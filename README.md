The Cyberpunk Blender add-on is designed to fully automate the shader setup for Cyberpunk 2077 mesh files. The add-on integrates directly with WolvenKit by making use of a bespoke material json file. To learn more about creating material json files please visit the [dedicated WolvenKit wiki page.](https://wiki.redmodding.org/wolvenkit/wolvenkit-app/editor/import-and-export-tool/blender-integration)

The Cyberpunk add-on requires Blender 2.92 or higher. Not all Cyberpunk shaders are currently supported by the add-on. If you're interested in adding support for a new shader please consider reaching out to us on our Discord, [Cyberpunk 2077 Modding Community.](https://discord.gg/Epkq79kd96)
